* Possible changes
To be clear, none of this code cleanup is needed for the sake of _this_ game; but it'll serve as a nice exercise in figuring out how to do similar things for the _next_ fifty games.

- [ ] Refactor away `global` statements by structuring state
- [ ] Lift event handling to the main() loop; avoid duplicating state
- [ ] Change over to framerate independent physics, see if that fixes up animation jankiness
- [ ] Eliminate the animation jankiness
- [ ] Add sound effects from sfxr

* Workflow stuff

- [ ] setup the `purpose` package in emacs; actually get the programming workflow that I'd like for pygame
